                    <p className="p-3">
                        I'm a 25 year-old graduate with a passion for all things digital and visual.
                        I graduated with a degree in History from the University of Birmingham in 2017 during which I
                        spent a year abroad at the University of Malta. <br/><br/>

                        I currently work in the heritage sector and I'm keen to explore ways of engaging a wider range of audiences 
                        with heritage using digital tools and outreach. 
                       <br/><br/>

                        For this reason I decided to return to the University of Birmingham for the Full Stack Web
                        Development
                        course.
                        I am currently developing a strong portfolio of web projects, some of which have been
                        included on my portfolio
                        page!
